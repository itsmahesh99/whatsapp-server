# Image Preview Fix - WhatsApp Server

## 🖼️ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Images were being sent as documents without preview (users had to tap to see the image)

**Root Cause**: The bulk multimedia endpoint was not properly handling image types and was falling back to document mode.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Bulk Multimedia Endpoint** (`/api/whatsapp/send-bulk-multimedia`)
- Now properly detects image and video types
- Sends images and videos as regular media (with preview)
- Sends audio as voice messages
- Only sends documents as documents
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. **Media Type Detection**
```javascript
// Images and videos → Regular media (with preview)
if (mimetype.startsWith('image/') || mimetype.startsWith('video/')) {
  await client.sendMessage(chatId, media); // Shows preview!
}

// Audio → Voice message
else if (mimetype.startsWith('audio/')) {
  await client.sendMessage(chatId, media, { sendAudioAsVoice: true });
}

// Everything else → Document
else {
  await client.sendMessage(chatId, media, { sendMediaAsDocument: true });
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Fix

### Test Single Image (should show preview):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/whatsapp/send-single-media \
  -F "contact={\"mobile\":\"your-number\",\"name\":\"Test\"}" \
  -F "message=Test image with preview!" \
  -F "sendAsDocument=false" \
  -F "media=@path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

### Test Bulk Images (should show preview):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/whatsapp/send-bulk-multimedia \
  -F "data={\"contacts\":[{\"mobile\":\"your-number\",\"name\":\"Test\"}],\"template\":\"Bulk image for {{name}}!\"}" \
  -F "attachments=@path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior Now

| Media Type | Endpoint | Behavior | Preview |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) | Single | Regular media | ✅ Shows preview |
| Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) | Bulk | Regular media | ✅ Shows preview |
| Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV) | Single | Regular media | ✅ Shows preview |
| Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV) | Bulk | Regular media | ✅ Shows preview |
| Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG) | Single | Voice message | ✅ Shows waveform |
| Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG) | Bulk | Voice message | ✅ Shows waveform |
| Documents (PDF, DOC, etc.) | Single | Document | ❌ No preview (normal) |
| Documents (PDF, DOC, etc.) | Bulk | Document | ❌ No preview (normal) |

## 🔧 Manual Override Options

You can still force document mode if needed:

### Single Media:
```javascript
// Force as document (no preview)
sendAsDocument: 'true'

// Force as sticker
sendAsSticker: 'true'

// Force audio as voice
sendAsVoice: 'true'

// Force video as GIF
sendAsGif: 'true'
```

### Bulk Media:
Currently automatically detects, but fallback to document mode is available if regular media sending fails.

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **WhatsApp Limits**: Large images may still be compressed by WhatsApp
2. **File Size**: Images > 16MB might be sent as documents automatically by WhatsApp
3. **Format Support**: Some image formats might not support preview (rare)
4. **Fallback**: If preview mode fails, it will automatically retry as document

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Images show thumbnails in chat (not file icons)
- [ ] Clicking images opens them directly (no download)
- [ ] Videos show preview frames
- [ ] Audio files show as voice messages
- [ ] PDFs and documents still show as files (this is correct)

Your WhatsApp server now properly handles image previews! 🎉
